# Red Hat Universal Nav

A universal nav web component.

Browser Support:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- IE11

## Getting Started
```
npm install && bower install
```

## Development
```
npm run dev
```
This will use babel to compile the src/ directory and copy to the lib/ directory. Open index.html in the browser and you should be good to go.

## About

This uses the [webcomponentsjs polyfill](http://webcomponents.org/) to create a cross-browser universal navigation web component. It uses the web component v0 spec and will need to be updated to the v1 spec when it's more widely supported.
